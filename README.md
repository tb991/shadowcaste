in simple terms

the file containing the text "hello world" through this program would lead to...

"hello world" ... "helo wrd" ... "drw oleh" -> "drwwol ewh" (might be mistakes done it in my head)

and the file containing "drwwol ewh" would through the reverse alg produce

"hello world"

im recovering from psychiatry. this is a dumb program but ive been unable to code for 2 years since being medicated. so it's valuable anyway (to me)
