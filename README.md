in simple terms

the file containing the text "hello world" through this program would lead to...

"hello world" ... "helo wrd" ... "drw oleh" -> "drwwol ewh" (might be mistakes done it in my head)

and the file containing "drwwol ewh" would through the reverse alg produce

"hello world"

im recovering from psychiatry. this is a dumb program but ive been unable to code for 2 years since being medicated. so it's valuable anyway (to me)

this alg, though so simple someone must have done it before, has a very interesting property, if you add some random symbol and remember where you put it, you seem to be able to sort of encrypt the file with tiny amounts of effort,,, for example, if i use this on some file, and then i put in one symbol that did not occur in the file, the whole thing becomes quite scrambled if i try to use the original program to de-encode it,,,though clearly a cryptanalysist would probably find it very simple i am not sure,,,
